# About

This is a case study project for the "Front-end Optimization: Basic and Intermediate Methods" course available on Udemy:
https://www.udemy.com/course/front-end-optimization-basic-and-intermediate-methods/

The page is available in three versions:
- unoptimized - built with jQuery,
- unoptimized - built with pure JavaScript,
- optimized - built with pure JavaScript as well.

Each one has a basic slider, a dynamically generated list of trips, filtering and sorting options.

Follow the course to learn more about differences between those three versions.
